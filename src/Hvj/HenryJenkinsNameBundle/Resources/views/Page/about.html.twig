    <article> <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Henry. I recently graduated from the University of
Canterbury with a Bachelor of Engineering, 2nd class Honours, with a major in
Computer Engineering. Feel free to have a look at some of the projects I have
been working, most of my code and schematics are available on GitHub, else I am
happy to provide them, just ask.</p>
